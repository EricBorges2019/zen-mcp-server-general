"""
TextRefactor tool - Step-by-step text restructuring and improvement with systematic investigation

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive text document refactoring and reorganization.
It guides the CLI agent through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough document examination, structure assessment, and improvement identification.
The tool supports complex refactoring scenarios including content reorganization, clarity enhancement,
argument strengthening, and style consistency improvements.

Key features:
- Step-by-step document refactoring workflow with progress tracking  
- Context-aware file embedding for text documents (markdown, txt, etc.)
- Automatic improvement opportunity tracking with categorization
- Expert analysis integration with external models for collaborative text restructuring
- Support for focused refactoring (organization, clarity, arguments, style, flow)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization for comprehensive text improvements
